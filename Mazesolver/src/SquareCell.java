 * SqureCell is the representation of a Cell in a
 * SquareCellMaze.  It is a nested class (as opposed to an inner
 * class like the Iterators...notice the "static" keyword in the
 * class's delcaration.  This is because a SquareCell does not
 * really need to, and should have no knowledge of the maze it
 * is a part of. (Keeping a strict hierarchy of knowledge makes
 * most OO inheritence hierarchy sane.  Otherwise they blow up
 * like a big big balloon).  This class is nested because,
 * basically, no one else should really have interest in
 * creating a SquareCell.  It's really a property of the
 * SquareCellMaze.
